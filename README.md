# Alpine-aarch64-Initramfs-Linux-OS-Project
A RAM only minimal operating system concept for my ARM chromebook, with a reference stock init generated by a rockchip SBC too

Of course, there are multiple projects in here due to me releasing rootfs, nothing proprietary was distributed, but anything is still subject to their original licenses I suppose.
This just aims to provide a firewall, many Linux functions, SSH client, a browser, and a possible GUI environment for terminals and is based on proot-distro's Alpine rootfs.

Anyways permissions are not saved, so you might need to change the permissions back to root if needed if you're going to use this for your own devices.
